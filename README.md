# Ranking Ballots

Issue: Rankings are important especially in fighting game communities because sponsorships and money are decided on them.
To keep track of player ranks, and who does the rankings within esport communities is hard. Everyone has to fill out their own 
sudo-ballot through excel and then combine them, or talk in person to decide which person/team should be ranked where. 

That's why I've made Ranking Ballots. You create a live ballot, put the players names who will be ranked, select how many 
people you want to rank the ballot, and it's done.  You get a list of random and dynamically generated links for the people
you want to rank the ballot. Send the links out and live ranking data will be updated based off of what your rankers do. You can check the 
ranks anytime by simply typing in the title of the ranking ballot you've created.
